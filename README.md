## Shopify Backend Challenge

Hello! In this repository is my submission to the Shopify Backend Intern Challenge for Summer 2022.

This repository contains the code for a Flask web application which allows users to create, edit and delete inventory items and also view all the inventory items in a list as well! Additionally this application also features the ability to download all of the product data as a csv file.

It is important to note that in order to start this application Python 3 must be installed. This can be done by following the steps in this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Start the Application

To start the application first clone the repository to a working directory using git. Once the project is cloned, navigate to the directory which includes the requirements.txt file.

After this open a terminal/command prompt window in your current directory and run the command below.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the previous command is completed, in the same terminal/command prompt window run the command below. 

```
python main.py
```
This command will launch the Flask web application on localhost:5000


If Python 3 and Python 2 are both installed in your computer you many need to run the following commands instead:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python3 main.py
```
